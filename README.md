# TikTakToe *[in construction]*
Hello! This project is my way of diving deeper into C programming while having some fun :P.
Currently it isn't completed yet as the game logic hadn't been started yet and the interface is... meh to say the least.
Also it's only windows support as I'm using Win32, I have my complaints with that api but I couldn't find a better substitude for now.

*stay tuned for more updates**
