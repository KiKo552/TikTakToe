# A basic tiktaktoe I made with only C
Hello! This project is my way of diving deeper into C programming while having some fun :P.
Although the gui isn't 'stylish' and some functionalities have not been implemented yet, the game is functional to say the least :P 
Also it's only windows support as I've only been using Win32, I have my complaints with that api but I couldn't find a better substitude for now.

# Usage
- Just run the `Gui.c` code (or it's execution)
